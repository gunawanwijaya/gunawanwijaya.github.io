        One of my very first project as freelancer on web stuff. The project is
        a company profile for preschool education that teach kids to read and
        spell (not magic or witchcraft!). The owner is requesting a rework for
        this project on early 2015 after I leave the project.

        website that the prior is looks old and no fun. Then team decided to

        grant user a promotional code. Just a simple clicking game. At first,
        its lagging, like hell, my co-worker ask why not use a game engine?
        what the hell, that's too overkill dude. In the end, yet another

        The client is a villa owner in Lombok, he want a nice video of his
        place and luxury looking website, so the basic update is fullpage video
        background on the home screen, different image on certain pages. This
        one, the logic is quite simple but required much attention to detail
        and so many test, some best practice is in mobile decided to use still
        image instead of video, also not all menu is shown on mobile. After a
        while they want to stop using video as background.
