Hi there, this is only a gist on how to build a great product taken from the
perspective of team management especially tech team

## TL;DR

- Having a good backup
- Analyze your weakness, harness your strength
- Work with others with empathy
- Challenge yourself & learn a lot
- Open to suggestion and critic
- Sharing is caring

<!--more-->

## Prolog

before talking about building a great product, let me tell you a story on how I
land a job that fits with my dreams.

> I want to make something impactful, for myself as learning phase and for others
> that bring benefits for most people.

Not long time ago i'm jobless for about 6 months, previously I work for a digital
agency based in Singapore, they have a great business team that usually deals
a project with government official. But that's not my dream.

Until I start asking for more, once i try to apply in another digital agency,
one in Jakarta, and one in Bali. I thanked God that all of them reject all my
application.

## Having a good backup

Soon after the rejection, I call my friend (one of my backup) that can refer me
to his friend that work in Pomona, and fortunately they trust me to help them
build this product.

I start work as a Software Engineer bcs of my background, having a degree in
Computer Science. FYI, I'm not that bright, but I learn that I need to be
responsible, start with my own life to finish my degree

Sometimes life hit you hard, just bear with it and endure the damage

So, yeah, i got to work with my dreams, well not exactly my dream, but i can
adjust my mission to have the same alignment with my Pomona's mission

## Analyze your weakness, harness your strength

My weakness are:

- poor time management
- mood swing
- perfectionist, takes longer time to do something due to extra effort

My strength are:

- quite good at programming & logic
- analytical thinking
- perfectionist, build something extra

## Work with others with empathy

At this point I realize, I'm not gifted, I'm not special. The next step is
incorporating myself with the team, i learn a lot from my past, like profiling
a personality of certain someone, restrain my ego, and not to judge people quickly.
this is usually called empathy, respect people same as you respect yourself.

This is not originally my way of thoughts, but by observing the CTO that treat
people around him nicely without lacking of professionalism, kudos to him that
gives me such inspiration.

## Challenge yourself & learn a lot

Challenge and try to compete & beat your old self, here in Pomona we don't lacks
any challenge, especially the technical ones.

From how to make an efficent data structure & data flow, security & privacy,
end-to-end communication from microservice, the summary is a great product
that loved by our lovely users, a profitable business, and engineer friendly

If you ask me, the priority of satisfying rate, is like this:

1. 45% engineer (employee)
1. 30% users
1. 25% business (client)

The very first user is the engineer itself, so it's natural to hear what they feel
about the product, from business perspective, engineers is trying to solve
business problem translated to business logic application

## Open to suggestion and critic

Sometimes we lost track of ourself, and we need to take a break, if we don't stop,
rest assured, team, people around us is notice it and let us know about our current
state and what we need to do, if no one care about you, then you need to evaluate
the team, is it still working as a team?

Once we hear a suggestion, try to reach this expectation and try to slowing down
a little bit and start a new pace

## Sharing is caring

Scrum & agile is nice to have, but if not possible, prepare a time once a week
to make a report (prefer verbal only) on your working progress, and sharing a new
knowledge to the other, this is a powerful way to train your brain, by sharing
your brain capacity of learning is boosted & you can even hear other people's
knowledge
